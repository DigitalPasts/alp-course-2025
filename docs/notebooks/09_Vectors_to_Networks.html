<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>In this notebook we continue with vector space models, visualize our ancient datasets through network analysis, and analyse the networks using graph theory. How can we tap into the potential of the mathematics behind graph theory for textual and historical connections? This notebook will present a selection of fundamental terms and concepts in graph theory that are easily applicable to exploratory network analysis. Exploratory network analysis involves applying exploratory data analysis methods to network data. It encompasses a variety of statistical and visual techniques aimed at examining the structure of networks, including the positions of nodes and edges. These methods help identify specific structures or patterns of interest, such as central nodes, and provide an overview of the network’s structure to inform further analysis.</p>
<p>This notebook has been prepared by <strong>Eliese-Sophia Lincke and Shai Gordin</strong> based on the notebook and research prepared by <strong>Avital Romach</strong> for lesson 05, and drawing content from a tutorial on graph theory and network analysis of <strong>Shai Gordin</strong>. It should be cited accordingly (see citation information at the bottom).</p>

<p>The field of graph theory began in the Prussian city of Königsberg. Leonhard Euler, who did not live in the city, published in 1736 his solution to what is now considered the foundational problem of graph theory: the “Königsberg problem of seven bridges” (<a href="https://archive.org/details/commentariiacade08impe/page/128/mode/2up"><em>problema Regiomontanum de septem pontibus</em></a>). The problem questioned whether one can find a single path crossing <strong>only once</strong> each of the seven bridges over the <a href="https://www.geonames.org/505540/pregolya.html">river Pregel</a>. In the terminology of network analysis: is there a set of connected nodes that crosses every edge only once. This is easily applicable to the field of textual manuscripts: are there certain manuscripts or genres that could be crossed or had to be crossed to get from text A to text B, and then, what were the ramifications of that on or for scholarly agents or officials using the text?</p>

<p>Euler showed that in the case of the Königsberg multigraph, there isn’t a path that crosses every bridge – i.e.&nbsp;passes every edge (in graph theory also <em>E</em>) – only once. This led to the general conclusion that when there are nodes or vertices (in graph theory <em>V</em>) with an odd number of edges, it affects the characteristics of the network as a whole. Modern social network analysis terms this “the number of nodes of odd degree”, meaning, the number of nodes that have an odd number of edges. If a network has either 0 or exactly 2 nodes of odd degree, then there exists a path which follows each edge only once. This is termed a <strong>Eulerian network</strong> or graph. But, if there is 1 node of odd degree, or 3 or more nodes of odd degree, it is impossible to follow every edge only once.</p>

<p>Four types of graph representations from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-802916-9.00007-5">Perez and Germon (2016: Fig 7.3)</a>: The graph is composed of four <strong>nodes</strong> and three <strong>edges</strong> connecting between them; it is easy to see from the adjacency matrix and adjacency list that all nodes are of odd degree. An example of a <strong>path</strong> is {A→B→C}, which is the path from node A to node C.</p>
<p>The Eulerian example is just one of many known quantitative aspects and theoretical models applicable to many graphs and networks describing real world situations, from roads, to power grids, to social and economic relations. Thus, the mathematics of graph theory has the potential to reveal <em>dynamic</em> patterns in historical networks, understanding the movement of entities inside the graph and how they relate to each other, especially in graphs that are too big for humans to analyze visually. In other words, applying mathematical aspects of graph theory can achieve new insights into networks, instead of them remaining <em>static</em> data visualizations, as often happens in the humanities.</p>
<p>Graph theory is a rich field in mathematics, with many underlying principles on the inherent nature of certain types of behaviors within a network, that is based on mathematical formulae. Like the example of Euler above, we can learn more about the nature of the relationships in our networks, if we understand even a little bit about the principles governing the relationships within the data. Here we will present a selection of fundamental terms and concepts in graph theory that are easily applicable to historical data: 1. <strong>Degree distribution</strong> 2. <strong>Scale free network</strong> 3. <strong>Betweeness centrality</strong> 4. <strong>Hubs</strong> 5. <strong>Bridges</strong></p>

<p>A simple network measure is a node’s ‘degree’, which is the total number of connections (edges) it has with other nodes. For a variety of data sets and social scientific problems, the distribution of degree values across all nodes in a network can be particularly revealing.</p>
<p><strong>Degree distribution</strong> &gt; Defined as the probability distribution of all degrees over the whole network. The measure is commonly used to compare the structure of networks since the publication of the <strong>“scale-free” network</strong> structure. In scale-free networks, the degree distribution follows a <strong>power-law</strong>.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="identifying-hubs-and-bridges-node-degree-vs-betweenness-centrality">Identifying Hubs and Bridges: Node degree vs Betweenness centrality</h4>
<p><strong>Betweenness centrality</strong> indicates mathematically how central a node is. For every pair of nodes in the graph, there is a shortest path to get from one to the other. Their path can cross other nodes along the way. The <strong>more shortest paths</strong> that pass through a node, the higher its betweennes centrality score. Thus, these nodes function as <strong>bridges</strong> in the network.</p>

<p>The majority of texts in the network have both a low degree score – meaning, they have a low number of edges connecting them to other places – and also a low betweenness centrality score, meaning they do not function as bridges, connecting between different places. There are only a few placenames that have significantly higher degree, functioning as hubs.</p>

<p><strong>Eigenvector centrality</strong> serves the purpose to identify influential nodes in a network based on the premise that <strong>connections to high-scoring nodes</strong> (= high eigenvector centrality) contribute more to a node’s score.</p>
<p>Very questionable from a moral point of view but well illustrating the concept is this example that ChatGPT-4 produced for us:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Think of the eigenvector as a magical list that scores each person at the conference on their influence. This list isn’t just made up by counting how many hands each person shakes (which would be a simpler measure = degree). Instead, it’s like a loop where: * Each person gets points not only for every handshake but gains extra points if the people they shook hands with are themselves high-scorers (= high value in the eigenvector) on this magical list. * This creates a chain reaction. Being connected to influential people boosts your score, and your score helps boost the scores of those you’re connected to, in a cycle. * Other real world examples: * Social Media: On platforms like Twitter or Facebook, some people are considered more influential not just because they have a lot of followers, but because many of their followers are themselves influential. * Academic citations: In academia, a researcher’s importance is often measured not only by how many papers they have published but also by how often their papers are cited by other highly regarded scientists.</p>

<p>“A node with a high eigenvector centrality is a node that is connected to other nodes with a high eigenvector centrality.” (Collar, Anna et al.&nbsp;2015, Networks in Archaeology: Phenomena, Abstraction, Representation, <em>J Archaeol Method Theory</em> 22, 1–32, DOI 10.1007/s10816-014-9235-6, p.21)</p>

<p>Identifying sub-groups of connected nodes within your network is one of the more common tasks in network analysis, especially in social network analysis (SNA). Two main definitions of connected elements are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Clique</strong>: A clique is a subset of nodes in a network, where every pair of nodes is connected by an edge. In the social sciences, only cliques of <em>three nodes or more</em> are usually considered. The definition of a clique is independent of whether it applies to the whole network or not. For example, a network can consist of multiple cliques, or an entire network can be one clique. The latter can also be called a complete network. (Collar, Anna et al.&nbsp;2015, Networks in Archaeology: Phenomena, Abstraction, Representation, J Archaeol Method Theory 22, 1–32, DOI 10.1007/s10816-014-9235-6, p.19).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Community</strong>: A sub-group of nodes that is densely connected internally. (Peeples, Matthew A. and Robert J. Bischoff. 2023 Archaeological networks, community detection, and critical scales of interaction in the U.S. Southwest/Mexican Northwest Journal of Anthropological Archaeology 70:101511).</p></li>
